        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p1>At Awesome Ski & Snowboard Repair, we combine passion, experience, and expertise to bring you top-quality ski and snowboard services. Our founder has been immersed in the ski world for over 30 years, with a deep love for the sport and a commitment to ensuring every piece of equipment is performing at its best. <br><br>

            With 32 years of skiing experience and a background that includes studying ski and snowboard business at Colorado Mountain College, we bring both knowledge and hands-on skill to every repair. As someone who passed a ski and snowboard repair and tuning course at the top of their class, our founder knows exactly how to fine-tune gear for maximum performance. <br><br>
            
            Before starting this business, our founder spent 4 years as a ski instructor at Crystal Mountain, where they not only honed their own skills on the slopes but also shared their expertise with others. Having attended the prestigious Camp of Champions in Whistler, BC, they continue to stay at the forefront of ski and snowboard innovation.<br><br>
            
            Though initially a hobby, ski and snowboard repair has always been a passion. Now, what started as a hobby is growing into something more â€” with big plans for the future. Our goal is not just to offer repair services but also to one day design and sell custom skis and snowboards that reflect the same quality and craftsmanship we bring to our work today.</p1>
